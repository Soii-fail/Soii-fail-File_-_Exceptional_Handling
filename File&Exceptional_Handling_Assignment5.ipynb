This speeds up development but frequently results in slower performance because the code is run directly without first being translated to machine code. Compilable languages, such as C or C++, on the other hand, are first converted into machine code by a compiler before being executed. Because the computer can understand the machine code directly, this leads to speedier execution; however, it necessitates an additional compilation step before the program can start."

Nevertheless, cyclic references—where items reference one another—cannot be handled by this approach. Python employs a cyclic garbage collector to deal with this, searching for and eliminating such cycles on a regular basis.

        "23. What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python ?\n",
        "    - Python memory management presents a number of difficulties. First, Python automatically manages memory through garbage collection and reference counting, which might result in memory leaks if circular references are not handled correctly. Performance bottlenecks may arise when handling huge datasets or objects with high memory consumption, even though Python's memory allocation is generally efficient. Furthermore, in multi-threaded systems, the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) may restrict the amount of RAM that may be used concurrently, which could affect performance. It may also be more difficult to optimize memory utilization in memory-intensive applications when there is no direct control over memory allocation and deallocation.\n"

        "    - In some applications, multithreading is crucial because it enables activities to be completed simultaneously, increasing performance and efficiency. A software can fully utilize multi-core processors by splitting it up into several threads, each of which handles a distinct aspect of the work. This is especially helpful for CPU-intensive jobs that can be parallelized, including data processing or intricate computations. Furthermore, multithreading makes applications more responsive, such as web servers or user interfaces, where several threads manage input/output operations. This allows the software to stay responsive while carrying out demanding tasks in the background. All things considered, multithreading improves user experience and speed."
